Welcome! I am a second-year Finance PhD student at University of Rochester (Simon Business School). Prior to joining Simon, I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Economics at Korea University. I also worked briefly at JP Morgan as a Risk Specialist before starting my academic journey. My research interest lies broadly in asset pricing, alongside probabilistic machine learning and investor preferences (ambiguity aversion).
